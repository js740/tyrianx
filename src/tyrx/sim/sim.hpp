// takes the state it works on instead of using the C globals.  Code moves
// here from port/ as the globals it uses move into structures.
//
// Each function must match the C code it ports exactly.  The shadow tick
// checks that for the code the level tick runs, and check/diff.cpp checks the
// functions it wraps call by call (TYRX_DIFF).
