Tyrian X
================================================================================

A fork of OpenTyrian, an open-source port of the DOS game Tyrian.

Tyrian is an arcade-style vertical scrolling shooter.  The story is set
in 20,031 where you play as Trent Hawkins, a skilled fighter-pilot employed
to fight MicroSol and save the galaxy. Tyrian features a story mode, one- and
two-player arcade modes, and networked multiplayer.

In the early to mid 1990s, Jason Emery wrote Tyrian in Pascal and x86 assembler
that he later shared with the OpenTyrian team for their C/SDL rewrite. This
project will rewrite large subsystems of OpenTyrian in C++ to facilitate future
enhancements that would be infeasible with the current design.

== FORK BACKGROUND =============================================================

This fork's ultimate goal is to decouple animation and game tick (35 Hz default)
rates to get smoother motion while keeping gameplay bitwise identical. Although
this in theory is a cosmetic enhancement not opposing OpenTyrian's mission of
high-fidelity preservation of the original game, in practice it needs to heavily
rewrite more critical (and fragile) code than that project can risk.

Tyrian supported multi-layer parallax backgrounds, translucency, and drastically
higher sprite counts than the contemporary SNES/Genesis consoles, without the
tile and sprite rasterization chips they had. It tied frame and game tick rates,
with memory mapped pixel blitting deeply interleaved in gameplay code to reach
35 fps (half of VGA mode 13h's frame rate) on 486s. Because CPU power after 30
years is so crazily higher (and we don't have to/can't write pixels indidually
directly across a VLB/PCI bus anyway), this intermingling has changed from a
necessity to a hindrance, so it's time for some considerable Spring cleaning!

Thank you to Jason Emery, Daniel Cook, Alexander Brandon, Andras Molnar, the
rest of the original game staff, and the OpenTyrian team.
